# PlutoniumAltLauncher 
#### *Plutonium Alternative Launcher*

A [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/) launcher that allows you to play while being offline, mainly developed with Steam Deck in mind and powered by [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/).
It has controller, touchscreen, mouse/kb support and works on both Linux (through Wine/Proton) and Windows.

The main objective is giving a shortcut to play offline Call of Duty Plutonium-supported titles.

**Oh btw, I'm not affiliated with the Plutonium team in any capacity, show some gratitude to the devs!**

## Requirements
- Call of Duty game files
- [Plutonium](https://cdn.plutonium.pw/updater/plutonium.exe)

## How to install
1. Download and extract the `PlutoniumAltLauncher.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/framilano/PlutoniumDeckLauncher/releases)
2. Here's my folder structure in `/home/deck/NoLauncherGames/Plutonium`:

```
├── PlutoniumWAW    # Contains World at War game files
├── PlutoniumBO1    # Contains Black Ops 1 game files
├── PlutoniumBO2    # Contains Black Ops 2 game files
├── PlutoniumIW5    # Contains MW3 game files
├── plutonium.exe   # Plutonium executable downloaded from Plutonium site
└── PlutoniumAltLauncher
    ├── Assets
    ├── config.json
    └── PlutoniumAltLauncher.exe
```
You can change this folder structure editing the `config.json` file.

3. Add `PlutoniumAltLauncher.exe` as non-steam game in `Desktop Mode`.
4. Set `Proton Experimental` or `Proton-GE` in compatibility settings, `Proton GE` is recommended.
5. Add the following line (if you're on kernel < 6.14 or without the NTSync module loaded) on command launch arguments (fsync and esync are known to cause issues with BO1/2):

   `PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1 %command%`

6. With NTSYNC on kernel >= 6.14 and `Proton-GE` integrating it by default there's no need for these launch arguments anymore. You still can't use NTSYNC on Steam Deck until Valve updates the kernel.
7. Start the program, you need to first boot the classic plutonium launcher (so it can download required files inside the proton prefix). Close everything and reboot the launcher, you're done!

## Extra
- You need to install through `Protontricks` the `xact` audio library to have all Sound FXs on BO1 and WAW
- You can edit `config.json` from the program itself when clicking/touching on the settings icon on the top right of the screen. You'll probably need a mouse or trackpads for better navigation in settings.
- It's my first dotnet project, have mercy
- Why a Windows launcher and not native Linux? Because I wanted to simplify the whole configuration process, add PlutoniumAltLauncher.exe as non steam game, that's it, no looking for Proton versions, no different prefix for Plutonium itself. Just a single prefix with everything related to Plutonium.

## Configuration

There are some editable fields in `config.json`:
- `PlutoniumExecutablePath` set your plutonium.exe path
- `IngameUsername` set your ingame username while playing offline
- `T4/5/6/IW5 FolderPath` set your game files path
- `CloseAtLaunch` exit the launcher when booting the game, or leave it in background so you can open it back later
- `DisableBackgroundMusic` disable the background music immediately

## Building
```
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
robocopy PlutoniumAltLauncher/Native/libvlc PlutoniumAltLauncher/bin/Release/net10.0/win-x64/publish/libvlc /MIR
```

## Todo
- [X] Add Controller support
- [X] Play background music
- [X] Set IW5SP image
- [X] Replace images with higher resolution ones? Meh
- [X] Stop music when launching Plutonium
- [X] Option to close Launcher automatically when launching Plutonium
- [X] Change music (and loop it) when changing game in main menu
- [X] Check if player started Plutonium at least once
- [ ] Replace that horrible settings icon
- [ ] Better UI in settings, controller navigation?

## Issues
- Blank screen on some windows randomly while using Gamescope, just moving the pointer fixes it, weird
- Black screen with Mangohud enabled on Gamescope
